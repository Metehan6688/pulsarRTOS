Currently **under development and not in a working state**.

## Purpose
To explore RTOS internals such as scheduling, task management, and low-level kernel mechanisms.

- Unstable API
- Everything may change

Note: Kernel has a panic problem. Sometimes I saw kernel panic, sometimes reset-loop for esp32.  I tested it only ESP32 Dev modeule now.
